# Chao Bear Apparel - Desktop & Mobile App (Front-End)
Chao Bear Apparel is a sports brand that prints products on demand. I used this code for https://chaobear.com, https://wonderland.chaobear.com and the Rakuten stores: https://japan.kassotis.com, https://korea.kassotis.com, https://india.kassotis.com. It's a practical theme if you're looking to turn your blog into an eshop.

This project is closely linked to the official Chao Bear app for Google Play. Thanks to its responsiveness it acts as a perfect UI for the mobile app and that works by building the app as a browser that automatically redirects to the website's URL. You can download the app on your Android device for free and see how it works first hand [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderscage.chaobear).

Built within the code is a customer support chatbot named Bj√∂rn but its code isn't included here because it's proprietary and not subject to the MIT License (its code goes at the bottom right before the closing body tag so feel free to add your own chatbot there). The bot is made using Facebook Messenger and you can visit and talk to it although it's only programmed to talk about store business and isn't trying to pass the Turing Test. The Messenger link is [HERE](https://www.messenger.com/t/ChaoBearApparel).

## Getting Started

Once in the new page go to "Website Theme" and press the "Edit theme" button. Once you enter the customization page press the "Edit HTML" option at the top of the dashboard and you'll see your blog's entire code. Once there do a double click to select all of the code and delete it. Now copy paste the HTML file you see here and press "Save". Now you have installed the custom theme.
